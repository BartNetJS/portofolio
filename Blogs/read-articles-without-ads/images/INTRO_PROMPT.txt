[Prompt: "A clean, minimal hero image showing a person reading an article on a laptop or phone. The screen shows simplified text blocks (no real article copy), with distracting elements (ads, banners, pop-up) faded out or blurred in the background. Foreground: a focused reader smiling, holding a cup of coffee, with a warm, soft color palette and high contrast for accessibility. Include space on the right for the blog title overlay. Keep composition simple and readable for small screens. This prompt is written also as alt-text: 'Person reading a simplified, ad-free article on a laptop, with blurred ads in the background, warm colors, and a calm focused expression.'"]
