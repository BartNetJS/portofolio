Have you ever opened an online article, ready to learn something new — and then got lost between flashing banners, autoplay videos, and cookie consent pop-ups?

By the time you find the actual paragraph you wanted, your focus (and patience) is gone.

Here’s a simple trick that changes everything.

💡 The Tip

When you find an article that looks interesting but is buried under ads, copy the link — and paste it into ChatGPT or Claude (or any LLM chat).

Then ask:

> “Can you explain this article in simple terms?”
>
> or
>
> “Summarize this page in Dutch / French / Spanish.”

That’s it.
Within seconds, you get a clean, ad-free version of the text — explained clearly, in your own language, and ready for further questions.

🧠 Why This Works

Modern AI models can read, interpret, and summarize webpages. Instead of your brain filtering distractions, the model does it for you — surfacing the core ideas and even highlighting what matters most. You can then ask follow-up questions, check claims, or request counterarguments — something you can’t do with a static web page.

It turns reading into a conversation.

❄️ Bonus Tip — Reader Mode in Chrome (Mobile)

If you read on your phone and prefer to stay in the browser, you can activate a hidden Reader Mode in Chrome for Android:

Type this in the address bar: chrome://flags/#reader-mode-heuristics

Set “Reader Mode triggering” to “Always available.”

Restart Chrome.

Open an article — you’ll now see a bar at the bottom: “Show simplified view.”

Tap it to read in a clean, ad-free layout with just the text and images that matter.

(Note: This works mostly on articles and blogs, not on homepages or heavily scripted pages.)

🍀 Other Simple Reading Tips

- Ask for a shorter version: “Summarize this in 5 bullet points.”
- Learn in your native language: “Explain this in Dutch.”
- Go deeper: “Find another article with a different opinion.”
- Fact-check instantly: “Is this claim verified by reliable sources?”

💭 Final Thought

The internet hasn’t become unreadable — we just need smarter ways to read it.
AI tools can turn a noisy web experience into a focused, personal learning session.

Next time you hit a wall of pop-ups, remember:

Copy the link. Paste into ChatGPT or Claude. Ask. Learn. Discuss.
