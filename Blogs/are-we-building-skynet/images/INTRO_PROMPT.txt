[Prompt: "A thoughtful, cinematic hero image showing a stylized humanoid robot and a human silhouette facing each other across an illuminated bridge or data stream. The robot should look sophisticated but neutral (not menacing), with soft warm backlighting and a city skyline or server-rack bokeh in the distance. Include subtle representations of code and data (faint matrix-like text or translucent diagrams) fading into the background. Keep composition simple for small screens and provide clear space for overlay title text. Alt-text: 'Stylized robot and human face-to-face across a luminous data bridge, warm tones, soft backlight, city/server bokeh in background.'"]
