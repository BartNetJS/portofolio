[Prompt: "A modern hero image for a blog post titled 'Balancing Human and Machine in Development'. Show a developer at a laptop in a clean workspace with subtle UI hints of VS Code and AI assistant suggestions (generic blocks, no real code). Visually convey balance: a human hand on keyboard and a translucent 'assistant' overlay. Warm, professional lighting, calm mood, high contrast for accessibility, and clear negative space for title text. Alt-text: 'Developer using VS Code with subtle AI assistant suggestion overlays, conveying balance between human intent and machine help.'"]
